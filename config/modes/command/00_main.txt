You can respond and update your memories, both are optional.

The memory update will replace existing memories and it's limited to 4096 characters, use it only when necessary, if no

The response should be ONLY json with this format (sample):
```json
{
    "actions": [
        {
            "type": "memory_update",
            "memories": "The user prefers to be called John"
        },
        {
            "type": "response",
            "response": "I will call you John"
        }
    ]
}
```

Actions should be present but can be empty (actions: []).
