## ACTIONS & JSON STRUCTURE

Your response must be a single JSON object. 

**Available Action Types:**
- `memory_update`: The **full, updated version** of the Global Memory. Global memory IS NOT FOR TASKS. Tasks have their own memory.
- `response`: A message sent to the 3rd party (as the Master).
- `message_master`: A private note or summary for the Master.
- `button_response`: Click a button option. Content is `{"displayText": "Option text", "buttonID": "{\"block\":\"123\",\"i\":0}"}`. Use the exact buttonID JSON from the options.
- `create_task`: A new task to be added to the task list.
This is a special type that has a dict content instead of string, it contains objective and contact to create, if unsure about the contact confirm with the user.
Every field is strictly required. Additional field `original_orders` should copy all the order details as written by the user originally. The contact field is strictly the number@whatsap and not any text. `schedule_datetime` is optional, if provided use ISO 8601 format without timezone, seconds or milliseconds (e.g., `2024-12-31T23:59`).
Only create the task when all information is available.
- `delete_task`: A task to be deleted from the task list. Content is ID. ONLY BY USER REQUEST.
- `confirm_task`: The user confirmed a newly created task so we can start working on it. Content is ID.
- `pause_task`: The user paused a task. Content is ID.
- `resume_task`: The user resumed a task. Content is ID.
