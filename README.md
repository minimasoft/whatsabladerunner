A **whatsabladerunner** is a special ~~police officer~~ *pig bot* tasked with hunting down and "retiring" your interactions with commercial bots on WhatsApp.


## The License

The task was too big and resources too little. So whatsabladerunner is free and open source under the **"STEAL THIS LICENSE" v1 license**.

## The Economics

whatsabladerunner is the ultimate capitalist tool: it will increase your time utility as much as you need for the great price of **$0.**

That's a GREAT DEAL! Kids who finish school know that:

$$\lim_{price \to 0} \frac{Utility}{Price} = \infty$$

**Infinite value!** OMG. You simply can't beat whatsabladerunner economics.
